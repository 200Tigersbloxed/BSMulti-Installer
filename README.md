okay now time for actual information

## What is this?
This is a simple installer for Beat Saber Multiplayer and Beat Saber Multiplayer Lite
(their links)
Multiplayer: https://github.com/andruzzzhka/BeatSaberMultiplayer
Multiplayer Lite: https://github.com/Zingabopp/BeatSaberMultiplayer

## Is it simple
yeah

All you do is download the latest release, unzip, run the executable, allow it past screen thingy (it says it's dangerous cause it's not signed), select which multiplayer you want to install, select your Beat Saber directory, and press start and it's done.

## Is it a virus? It says "Windows Protected your PC"?
If you get the smart screen filter, you get it because the application isn't signed with a certificate. I assure you, this isn't a virus. Why would I make a virus and release it's source to GitHub? KEKW 5Head moment ladies and gentlemen.
