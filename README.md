okay now time for actual information

## What is this?
This is a simple installer for Beat Saber Multiplayer and Beat Saber Multiplayer Lite
(their links)
Multiplayer: https://github.com/andruzzzhka/BeatSaberMultiplayer
Multiplayer Lite: https://github.com/Zingabopp/BeatSaberMultiplayer

## Is it simple
yeah

All you do is download the latest release, unzip, run the executable, allow it past screen thingy (it says it's dangerous cause it's not signed), select which multiplayer you want to install, select your Beat Saber directory, and press start and it's done.
