# IMPORTANT

Due to a recent Attack to the main server, this installer won't work anymore. The website was breached, and I had to delete it. Don't worry, they got no info, cause I don't log any info on there (lolw they hacked it for nothing) but yeah.

All BSMulti-Installer services will be disbanded on 12/1/2020 in place for the official multiplayer. After 12/1/2020, this installer will no longer work properly. **THIS DOES NOT MEAN THE MULTIPLAYER/LITE MOD WILL NOT WORK**, you just won't be able to use this installer anymore.

This Repo will no longer recieve updates. All bugs will be marked with `wont fix` and any PRs will not be pulled. Making a Fork would be a better option.

All current issues will be closed.

okay now time for actual information

## What is this?
This is a simple installer for Beat Saber Multiplayer and Beat Saber Multiplayer Lite
(their links)
Multiplayer: https://github.com/andruzzzhka/BeatSaberMultiplayer
Multiplayer Lite: https://github.com/Zingabopp/BeatSaberMultiplayer

## Is it simple
yeah

All you do is download the latest release, unzip, run the executable, allow it past screen thingy (it says it's dangerous cause it's not signed), select which multiplayer you want to install, select your Beat Saber directory, and press start and it's done.

## Is it a virus? It says "Windows Protected your PC"?
If you get the smart screen filter, you get it because the application isn't signed with a certificate. I assure you, this isn't a virus. Why would I make a virus and release it's source to GitHub? KEKW 5Head moment ladies and gentlemen.
